1) Save the wordlist you found to a file on your computer
2) Go to the login page Insert in the username field "Elliot" and in the password field a random password
3) Turn on interception in the Burp Suite and hit the submit button on the login page
4) Once you have the request on Burp, bring it to the Intruder in the Payload section, upload your wordlist and then select the field that will change in each request, in this case the password field
5) Then Start the attack and since it will return the status code 200 at each request, you must go and check the length field
6) Eventually we will find this password:  ER28-0652
