1) I see the info of the thm.jpg file, and I use the discovered password :
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ steghide info thm.jpg                             
"thm.jpg":
  format: jpeg
  capacity: 1.0 KB
Try to get information about embedded data ? (y/n) y
Enter passphrase: 
  embedded file "hidden.txt":
    size: 101.0 Byte
    encrypted: rijndael-128, cbc
    compressed: yes
```

2) Ok, I extract the hidden files:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ steghide extract -sf  thm.jpg
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "hidden.txt".
```

3) I read the file:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cat hidden.txt                           
Fine you found the password! 

Here's a username 

wbxre

I didn't say I would make it easy for you!
```

4) I find a username and a password:
- Username: wbxre

5) I decrypt  the username with https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/, I discover that the password is in ROT13 format:
- Password : joker


6)  Then I think that the main image, the image that I see  in the main page of the ctf, https://tryhackme.com/room/madness, may be hiding a password

![[Pasted image 20221212182832.jpg]]

7) I see info, the password there isn't:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ steghide info cat.jpg        
"cat.jpg":
  format: jpeg
  capacity: 6.6 KB
Try to get information about embedded data ? (y/n) y
Enter passphrase: 
  embedded file "password.txt":
    size: 83.0 Byte
    encrypted: rijndael-128, cbc
    compressed: yes
```

8) I extract password file: 
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ steghide extract -sf cat.jpg 
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "password.txt".
```

9) I read the file:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cat password.txt
I didn't think you'd find me! Congratulations!

Here take my password

*axA&GF8dP
```

10) Now I have discover:
- Username: joker
- Password: ```*axA&GF8dP```

11) Login in ssh and discover user.txt:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
