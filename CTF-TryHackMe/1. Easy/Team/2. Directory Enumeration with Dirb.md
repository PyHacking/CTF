3) Then I search team.thm and I have find a new page
4) Ok, this "Web Application" it's very interesting, because now  I can do an Directory Enumeration:

6) Content of script.txt:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter Username: " REDACTED
read -sp "Enter Username Password: " REDACTED
echo
ftp_server="localhost"
ftp_username="$Username"
ftp_password="$Password"
mkdir /home/username/linux/source_folder
source_folder="/home/username/source_folder/"
cp -avr config* $source_folder
dest_folder="/home/username/linux/dest_folder/"
ftp -in $ftp_server <END_SCRIPT
quote USER $ftp_username

cd $source_folder
!cd $dest_folder
