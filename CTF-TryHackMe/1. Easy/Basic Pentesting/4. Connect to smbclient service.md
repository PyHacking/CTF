1) I have discover in the enumeration that there is a share:
```
        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        Anonymous       Disk       #Ci Servirà per connetterci al servizio smbclient
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (Samba Server 4.3.11-Ubuntu)
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.

Quindi mi connettterò al servizio con username:  Anonymous
                                                             password:  Anonymous

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ smbclient //10.10.42.233/Anonymous
Password for [WORKGROUP\kali]: Anonymous

-----
```
2) Then  I see the content of this directory: 
```
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Thu Apr 19 13:31:20 2018
  ..                                  D        0  Thu Apr 19 13:13:06 2018
  staff.txt                           N      173  Thu Apr 19 13:29:55 2018

------
```
3) After I import the file "staff.txt" in the local machine:
```
smb: \> get staff.txt
getting file \staff.txt of size 173 as staff.txt (0.8 KiloBytes/sec) (average 0.8 KiloBytes/sec)

-------
```
4) I read the file:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cat staff.txt                    
Announcement to staff:

PLEASE do not upload non-work-related items to this share. I know it's all in fun, but
this is how mistakes happen. (This means you too, Jan!)
