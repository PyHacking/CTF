1) I see the code source:
```html
<!DocType html>

<html>
<head>
<title>Annoucement</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
Dear agents,
<br><br>
Use your own <b>codename</b> as user-agent to access the site.
<br><br>
From,<br>
Agent R
</p>
</body>
</html>
```

2) Now with Burp Suite I create a wordlist with inside all the letters of alphabet  , this letters Burp Suite put  in the user agent, after I see that there is a Response that It has the status code: 302, that It is a redirection:
