1) There is a passwordGenerator under /home/steven, this appears to be a windows executable
2) There is also a png and a pdf file under /home/steven/.notes/
```
/home/steven/.notes/screenshot.png
/home/steven/.notes/notes.pdf
```
3)  The notes.pdf file is password protected, and the screenshot.png shows you what possible password complexity is used to generate the password.
4) Coming back to passwordGenerator. This is a windows 32 PE file, which is compiled using pyinstaller, to decompile it, use 
```
https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor
```
5) Note that this tool is made for 3.7, so, to ensure things can be extracted correctly, you need to install python3.7
6) Then, install uncompyle6 to decompile the passwordGenerator.pyc file, it is suggested to create a virtualenv for python3.7 so that you can always revert when things didn’t work out
```
# install virtualenv and activate
python.exe -m pip install virtualenv
python.exe -m virtualenv env37
env37\Scripts\activate

# extract content
python pyinstxtractor.py passwordGenerator

# decompile
pip install uncompyle6
uncompyle6 passwordGenerator.pyc
```
7) Reading the code, it would seem that there is a 32^128 combinations of passwords, however, running the code on these lines shows that the idx will only be a limited number of values due to how QT implements the random number generator.
```python
qsrand(QTime.currentTime().msec())
password = ''
for i in range(length):
    idx = qrand() % len(charset)
```
8) Copying the `genPassword` code and modify it to make it work.
9) Then create a while loop to genreate passwords, the process will become extremely slow at around 1000 passwords.
```python
from PySide2.QtCore import *


def genPassword():
    length = 32
    char = 0
    if char == 0:
        charset = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890~!@#$%^&*()_-+={}[]|:;<>,.?'
    else:
        if char == 1:
            charset = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
        else:
            if char == 2:
                charset = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890'
            else:
                pass
    try:
        qsrand(QTime.currentTime().msec())
        password = ''
        for i in range(length):
            idx = qrand() % len(charset)
            nchar = charset[idx]
            password += str(nchar)
    except:
        print('error')
    return password


def gen_possible_passes():
    passes = []
    try:
        while True:
            ps = genPassword()
            if ps not in passes:
                passes.append(ps)
                # print(ps)
                print(len(passes))
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        with open('pass.txt', 'w') as ofile:
            for p in passes:
                ofile.write(p + '\n')


gen_possible_passes()
```
10) Then use it with pdfcrack, you should have your password.
```
> pdfcrack -f notes.pdf -w ~/share/passwordGenerator_extracted/pass.txt

11) Open up the pdf file, you should have ethan’s password:
```
Dear Steven,
As we discussed since I'm going on vacation you will be in charge of system maintenance. Please
ensure that the system is fully patched and up to date.
Here is my password: b@mPRNSVTjjLKId1T
System Administrator
Ethan
```

Username: ethan
Password: b@mPRNSVTjjLKId1T

12) I read the user.txt:
```
